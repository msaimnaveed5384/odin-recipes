        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Granny Smith apple pie is a classic dessert known for its bright, 
            tangy flavor and perfectly balanced sweetness. 
            Made with firm, green Granny Smith apples, this pie stands out 
            because the apples hold their shape during baking and provide a 
            refreshing tartness that contrasts beautifully with sugar, cinnamon, 
            and butter. Encased in a golden, flaky pastry crust, the filling
            becomes tender and aromatic while maintaining a slight bite.</p> 
            <p>The sharp taste of Granny Smith apples prevents the pie from 
            becoming overly sweet, making it a favorite for those who enjoy 
            a crisp, well-balanced dessert. Served warm—often with vanilla 
            ice cream—it delivers a comforting yet lively flavor 
            experience 🥧🍏 </p>
