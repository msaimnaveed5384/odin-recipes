       <h2>Description</h2>
       <p>Banana Bread Baked Oatmeal is a warm, wholesome dish that 
        combines the comforting flavor of classic banana bread with 
        the hearty texture of baked oats. Made with ripe bananas, 
        rolled oats, milk, eggs, and gentle spices like cinnamon and 
        vanilla, it delivers natural sweetness and a soft, cake-like 
        consistency. As it bakes, the bananas infuse the oatmeal with 
        rich aroma and moisture, creating a satisfying balance between 
        nutrition and indulgence.</p><p> Often enjoyed as a breakfast or healthy 
        dessert, banana bread baked oatmeal is filling, nourishing, and 
        perfect when served warm—on its own or topped with nuts, yogurt,
         or a drizzle of honey 🍌🥣</p>
